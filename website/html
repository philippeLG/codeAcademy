#<html> and <body>
<!DOCTYPE html>

    <h1> Web Developpement </h1>

</html>

Everything inside a web page is nested inside the html element
The body element contains the actual content of the web page - everything nested inside <body> and </body> shows up in the web browser
The doctype at the start of the HTML file tells the browser which version of HTML you are using. The doctype is not an HTML element, so it doesn't have a closing tag. The doctype ensures that your web page displays consistently when its visited from different browsers.



# heading elements
Headings are described by heading elements. There are six levels of heading elements: h1 to h6.
The h1 element is used to describe the main heading of the page.

#Paragraphs
<p>

#Links
<a>
The defining feature of the Web is the presence of links. Clicking on links leads to other web pages. The a element is used to create links.
The a element is similar to the h1 or p elements, but it has two key differences:
First, it has an href attribute which equals the website you want to link to.
Second, you get to choose the link text that users see on the page.
